					<div id="img-caption">For his accomplishments, he received numerous industry awards, including the coveted National Speakers Association CPAE Award and the Master of Influence Award, presented in 2004 by then-NSA President Mark Sanborn. Speaker and author Chris Widener was in the audience and recalls the moment: â€œRight before Mark gave Jim the award, he asked the audience, 'How many of you would say that Jim Rohn has played a significant part or has made a significant impact in your life?' I looked out over the audience of about 2,500 speakers, and about two-thirds of the hands went up--about 1,800 people."</div>
